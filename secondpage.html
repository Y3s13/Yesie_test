      <p> How I got into sewing</p>
      <p style="font-size:70%;"> I was 7-9 years old when I started to sew, I watched people on YouTube people sewing all the time.
        The first thing I sewed was when I was fixing my rainbow dash slippers, I was sewing back the wings that fell out</p>
      <p>Timeline</p>
      <p style="font-size:70%;"> Age 7-8: I've fixed the wings of my rainbow dash slippers</p>
      <p style="font-size:70%;"> Age 9-10:I used my mom's and mine clothes that didn't fit me to sew, I mostly made small bags, I had 
      hand sew for the majority of my sewing experience </p>
      <p style="font-size:70%;"> Age 11-12: I quit sewing for a while, There is no specific reason why I quit sewing for a while but 
        i did</p>
      <p style="font-size:70%;"> Age 13-14: I started to sew again and my mom bought me a sewing machine, and I became the family 
      sewer. To be specific non-complicated stuff to fix (ex: putting a bias on the curtain, fixing a rip from shirt) </p>
